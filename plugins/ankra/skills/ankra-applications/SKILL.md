description: Take source code from a Git repository to a running deployment on one or many Ankra clusters - registering an application, the generated Dockerfile, chart and `.ankra/pipeline.yaml` (Ankra Pipelines, never a GitHub Actions workflow), the image registry it publishes to, environment secrets, deployments, auto-deploy, PR demos, and publishing the result as a catalogue add-on. Use when the user wants to deploy their own code with Ankra, mentions `ankra application`, connects a repository, asks how to get a service live, or wants the same service on several clusters.

# Ankra Applications

An **Application** is Ankra's link between a Git repository of source code and the clusters that
run it. Ankra reads the repository, generates the container build and the Kubernetes packaging,
publishes the image to a registry, and deploys it — so a service goes from source to production
without anyone hand-writing a Deployment.

Use this skill for *your own code*. For third-party software (a Helm chart someone else
maintains) use `ankra-stacks-addons`; the two meet when an application publishes its manifests as
a catalogue add-on.

## The lifecycle

```
repository → add → setup PR (Dockerfile, chart, .ankra/pipeline.yaml) → Ankra Pipelines build & publish
          → env-secrets → deploy to cluster → verify → auto-deploy / promote → many clusters
```

Every step has a CLI command; all of them are also visible in the portal's Applications tab.

## 1. Register the application

```bash
ankra application add .                      # detect repo, credential and branch from the checkout
ankra application add ./services/payments --name payments
ankra application add . --credential github-acme --branch main
```

`add` reads the local Git checkout: it detects the GitHub repository from the remote (`--remote`,
default `origin`), uses the remote's default branch, and picks the GitHub credential when the
choice is unambiguous.

**Declare a registry you already operate in the same command** — not afterwards:

```bash
ankra application add . \
  --registry-url oci://artifact.example.com/commerce \
  --registry-credential example-harbor \
  --registry-pull-secret commerce-registry
```

The setup job generates the build pipeline (`.ankra/pipeline.yaml`, run by Ankra Pipelines on the
organisation's CI cluster — never a GitHub Actions workflow) *from the declaration the application is
created with*. A registry added later leaves a pipeline that publishes to the wrong one, and you will
be debugging a push failure that has nothing to do with the code. With no declaration the
application publishes into the organisation's own Ankra registry project, which is the right
default when you do not already run a registry.

Related flags: `--registry-api-url`, `--registry-username-secret`, `--registry-password-secret`
and `--registry-manage-actions-secrets` — these name and populate repository Actions secrets and
matter only for an application still on the legacy generated GitHub workflow; an Ankra pipeline gets
its `registry_auth` minted per build from the application's push robot and needs none of them. See
[reference.md](reference.md) for the registry matrix (Harbor, ECR, GAR, ACR, GHCR, Docker Hub).

## 1b. From a Claude Design export (no repository yet)

A canvas exported from [Claude Design](https://claude.ai/design) can be registered without a
repository of its own: Ankra converts the artboards into a static site, creates the GitHub
repository under the credential's account, commits the site with a busybox `httpd` Dockerfile,
and registers the application - the same setup PR, build and deploy lane follows.

```bash
ankra application import claude-design ./neighborly-export --name neighborly
ankra application import claude-design neighborly.zip --credential github-acme --owner acme \
  --repository neighborly-site --source-url https://claude.ai/design/p/<id> --wait
```

`<path>` is a directory of the export (`<Name>.dc.html` artboards, `canvas.json`, images), a zip
of it, one artboard, or a saved canvas page (`.html`). `Main.dc.html` becomes `site/index.html`,
the other artboards `site/<name>.html`, and a multi-artboard canvas gets a `site/canvas.html`
index. Artboards that use template logic (`{{ }}` holes, `sc-for`/`sc-if`, `dc-import`, a
`data-dc-script`) are kept as authored and reported as warnings: they need the Claude Design
runtime and may not render as on the canvas - replace the logic with markup and import again, or
edit the page under `site/`. Re-running the same import registers the same repository without a
second commit (`.ankra/design-import.json` records the inputs); a changed export is refused -
use a new `--repository` name. The GitHub App cannot create repositories in a personal
account: use an organisation owner, or create the repository first and use `application add`.

## 2. Review what Ankra generated

Ankra opens a **setup pull request** carrying the Dockerfile, the Helm chart, and
`.ankra/pipeline.yaml`. Read it — this is the contract for everything that follows. The pipeline is
recorded as the definition of record before the PR opens, so Ankra Pipelines builds the next push
whether or not the PR has merged; `ankra application get <application-id> -o json` shows
`pipeline_source: ankra_pipeline`. A value of `generated_workflow` is an application from the legacy
lane — run `ankra application pipeline convert <application-id>` (see `ankra-ship` §3f).

```bash
ankra application list
ankra application get <application-id>
ankra application branches <application-id>
ankra application branch-files <application-id>      # what is tracked on the setup branch
ankra application files <application-id> \
  --file Dockerfile=./Dockerfile --message "Pin the base image"
ankra application retry <application-id>             # re-run a failed setup
```

Things worth checking before merging: the base image and its tag, the exposed port, the health
probe paths, resource requests, and that nothing secret was baked into the image.

The PR also carries `.ankra/ankra.yaml`, the application descriptor: `metadata`, the `options` that
are the deploy form's contract (edit them in Git and re-run setup to change the form), and an
optional `components:` block. When analysis reads a monorepo wrong (an API at the root built from
`deploy/docker/Dockerfile` beside a `web/` app reads as one app), declare the components there
(`name`, `subdir`, `dockerfile`, `container_port`) and reconcile: a declaration outranks the existing
workflows, the AI proposal and structural detection, and is the only way to remove a component. A
block Ankra cannot honour is refused whole, reported as the `read_declared_components` setup task,
and the recorded components are kept. Schema: https://docs.ankra.ai/reference/application-descriptor

## 3. Supply configuration and secrets

The generated manifests declare which environment values they need. Fill them in — a missing one
is the single most common reason a first deploy crash-loops.

```bash
ankra application env-secrets list <application-id>          # keys and their state
printf '%s' "$DATABASE_URL" | ankra application env-secrets set <application-id> DATABASE_URL
ankra application env-secrets set <application-id> API_TOKEN  # prompts without echo
ankra application env-secrets apply <application-id>          # seal into the deployments and roll
ankra application env-secrets delete <application-id> OLD_KEY
```

**Never pass `--value` on the command line.** It lands in shell history and, on a shared host, in
the process table. Pipe on stdin or let it prompt.

Storing a value does nothing until `env-secrets apply` seals it into the running deployments.
Non-secret configuration (base URLs, model names, feature toggles) belongs in cluster or
organisation variables instead — see `ankra-app-integrations`.

## 4. Deploy to a cluster

```bash
ankra cluster list                                    # find the target cluster id
ankra application deploy <application-id> --cluster <cluster-id> --namespace prod
ankra application deploy <application-id> --cluster <cluster-id> --mode high_availability --set replicas=3
ankra application deployments <application-id>        # where it is running
ankra application installations <application-id>      # installation intents and their state
ankra application jobs <application-id>               # the platform jobs behind those intents
ankra application remove <application-id> --cluster <cluster>  # take it off ONE cluster; it stays elsewhere
ankra application remove <application-id> --cluster <cluster> --stack <stack>  # a deploy-wizard deployment
```

`remove` uninstalls the deployment on that cluster (and the data in its database and volumes) and
keeps the application and its other deployments; `delete` removes the application everywhere.
A deployment made with the deploy wizard has no installation: pass `--stack` with the stack it runs
as (not together with `--namespace`). The other stacks that deploy created stay standing.
Confirm with the person before either.

`--mode quick` is the single-replica default; `--mode high_availability` asks for the resilient
shape. `--set key=value` binds the deploy inputs the chart declares.

Then verify, before you call it done:

```bash
ankra cluster operations list --cluster <cluster>     # did the platform execution succeed
ankra cluster get pods -n prod --cluster <cluster>
ankra cluster logs -l app=<name> -n prod --follow=false --tail 100
```

## 5. Continuous delivery

```bash
ankra application auto-deploy get <application-id>
ankra application auto-deploy set <application-id> --enabled        # or --enabled=false
ankra pipeline list --application <application-id>    # the Ankra Pipelines runs
ankra pipeline get <run-id> --application <application-id>
ankra pipeline run --application <application-id> --wait
```

Legacy only — an application whose `pipeline_source` is `generated_workflow`:
`ankra application workflow-runs <application-id>`, `ankra application workflow-run-jobs
<application-id> <run-id>`, `ankra application rerun-workflow <application-id> <run-id>` and the
organisation's CI runner label (`ankra application settings set --ci-runner-label self-hosted`)
read and steer the GitHub Actions workflow. Convert instead of tuning it:
`ankra application pipeline convert <application-id>`.

With auto-deploy on, a build Ankra observes on the tracked branch rolls itself out unattended.
With it off, a push still builds and waits for an explicit `ankra application deploy`. Choose
deliberately: auto-deploy is right for dev and staging, and for production only when the branch
is protected and the pipeline gates on tests.

**If `pipeline list` stays empty after a merge**, the pipeline is not failing — it has nowhere to
run. Ankra Pipelines execute on the cluster agent's own step scheduler, whose `ci_worker_count`
defaults to 0, so a freshly imported cluster produces zero runs and no error. Check with
`ankra cluster agent ci get --cluster <cluster>`, raise it with
`ankra cluster agent ci set --workers 2 --cluster <cluster>`, and dispatch with
`ankra pipeline run --application <application>` (add `--sha <full-sha>` to build a specific
commit). A run that concluded `skipped` with "at least one fatal violation", or a build refused
over `registry_auth`, is the unapproved default-branch definition: a human admin runs
`ankra pipeline definitions approve <definition-id>` once (`ankra pipeline get <run-id>
--application <application-id>` prints the id). Do not answer an empty run list by hand-writing a
GitHub Actions workflow — that forks the deploy contract away from the scans, chart publish and
managed registry auth this application already has. `ankra-cicd` §8 is the full troubleshooting table.

## 5b. Building without the repository's CI

Everything above routes the build through the Ankra pipeline generated for the repository. It can
also build the image itself, on its own builders, when that pipeline cannot yet run (no CI cluster,
no workers) — or for a legacy workflow application whose first image waits on the setup PR merge:

```bash
ankra application build start <application-id> --commit <full-sha> --ref main
ankra application build start <application-id> --commit <full-sha> --wait   # follow it; non-zero if it failed
ankra application build list <application-id>
ankra application build get <application-id> <build-id>
ankra application build request <application-id> <request-id>   # a queued ask, before it has a build
```

Ankra clones the commit, resolves a recipe (the repository's own Dockerfile, else a generated one,
else buildpacks), builds it and pushes the image — no Actions minutes, no runners to operate, and
no registry credentials in the repository.

Use it when the repository's CI cannot do the job: a private repository on a plan whose Actions
never run, a first image needed before anyone merges a PR, an unattended caller with no browser,
or a build the repository's own pipeline is failing to produce.

Two things to know. `--commit` takes a **full** 40- or 64-character sha — the queue deduplicates on
the string it is given, so an abbreviation would be a second key for the same commit. And a request
is not yet a build: `start` answers with a request id, and the build row appears when the scheduler
claims it, which is what `build request` reads and what `--wait` polls across.

A failed build carries an `error_class` that says whose failure it is. `build_failed` is the
repository's — read `error_message`. `clone_auth` and `recipe_missing` are the application's
configuration. `push_failed`, `timeout` and `capacity` are Ankra's, and Ankra can already see them.

The routes answer **404 while the `platform_builds` flag is off**, which is the default — the lane
runs untrusted code on a builder pool that has to exist first. Ask Ankra to enable it for your
organisation. A 404 on an application you can otherwise read means the flag, not the application.

## 6. Security scanning

```bash
ankra pipeline findings <run-id> --application <application-id>   # the run's Semgrep/Checkov/Trivy findings
ankra application code-security <application-id>      # source findings
ankra application container-security <application-id> # image CVEs
ankra application pull-request-reviews <application-id>
```

A generated `.ankra/pipeline.yaml` always carries the `scan` and `gate` stages; treat a pipeline
without them as unfinished. `ankra application upgrade-workflow <application-id>` adds scanning to
a legacy generated GitHub workflow only — prefer `ankra application pipeline convert
<application-id>`, which leaves that lane. See `ankra-security` for how these findings fit the wider
posture review.

## 7. Preview a branch before it merges

```bash
ankra application demo build <application-id> --branch <branch>   # is there a demo-ready image
ankra application demo deploy <application-id> --branch <branch> --ttl-hours 8
ankra application demo deploy <application-id> --pr-number 42
ankra application demo list <application-id>
ankra application demo detail <application-id> <demo-id>
ankra application demo logs <application-id> <demo-id>
ankra application demo stop <application-id> <demo-id>
ankra application demo fix <application-id> <demo-id>             # AI pre-setup mission on failure
ankra application demo fix-build <application-id> --branch <branch>
ankra application demo config <application-id>                    # saved demo defaults
```

Demos are ephemeral workspaces on the organisation's AI/staging cluster with their own TTL, and
they are reaped automatically. They are the reviewable artefact for a pull request — a public
preview URL, not a port-forward. Configure the staging cluster in **Organisation settings → AI →
Environment** (`ankra-ai-gateway`).

## 8. One service, many clusters

Do **not** repeat `application deploy` with hand-copied values per cluster. Two supported shapes:

**Publish the manifests as a catalogue add-on** — the application becomes installable software
other clusters pick up:

```bash
ankra application publish-addon <application-id> --version 1.2.0 \
  --display-name "Payments" --category backend --changelog "TLS defaults"
ankra application published-addon <application-id>
ankra application chart-versions <application-id>
ankra application manifest-addon <application-id>            # inspect, install, withdraw
```

**Or capture the deployed stack as a stack profile** — the right choice when each cluster needs
different values (domains, sizes, replica counts). Every per-cluster difference becomes a
parameter instead of a fork. See `ankra-stack-profiles`.

Either way the artefact is built once and promoted, never rebuilt per environment.

## 9. Ankra's own analysis of the application

```bash
ankra application platform <application-id> --cluster <cluster-id>   # operators already present
ankra application publish-readiness <application-id>
ankra application ai-config <application-id>                          # the AI lane configuration
ankra application reconcile <application-id>                          # request a refresh
```

`platform` detects which operators (ingress, cert-manager, a database operator) a target cluster
already runs, so the generated manifests reuse them rather than duplicating them.

## 10. Backups of an application's data

An application deploys as one stack per cluster, and the stack is what the backup lane protects.
These verbs address the deployment by its **cluster** and let the platform resolve the stack, so
nobody has to know that `shop` runs as `deploy-shop`:

```bash
ankra application backups <application-id>                                  # one row per deployment
ankra application protect <application-id> --cluster production             # turn scheduled backups on
ankra application backup  <application-id> --cluster production --wait      # back up now
```

`backups` answers, per deployment: whether it carries a database, its three-valued protection
verdict, its vault and schedule, when it was last backed up and when it is next scheduled. The
verdict's third value matters - `unknown` means Ankra could not establish whether the deployment
is protected, which is **not** the same answer as `unprotected`, and nothing should be reported as
unprotected on the strength of a read that did not happen.

**An application that ships a database is protected by default.** When it is deployed into an
organisation with backups enabled and exactly one verified backup vault, its stack is created with
a daily backup already on. The deploy says so, and says why not when it could not: no verified
vault, or more than one and nothing naming which - Ankra does not choose where somebody's data
lives. The per-application `database_backup` setting turns the default off; it is on the
application's Settings page in the portal and on
`PUT /api/v1/org/applications/{id}/backups/database-backup`.

Turning the default off decides the FUTURE. It does not unprotect a running deployment - that is
`ankra cluster stacks unprotect`, behind its typed confirmation.

The restore points these take are the same artefacts the stack lane lists, so
`ankra cluster stacks restore-points list <stack> --cluster <cluster>` and
`ankra cluster stacks restore-points restore` still work on them. See `ankra-backups` for vaults
and `ankra-migrate` for moving data between clusters.

## Rules

- **Declare the registry at `add` time.** A late `--registry-url` leaves a pipeline publishing to the
  wrong registry.
- **Ankra Pipelines, never a hand-written workflow.** `add` lands on `.ankra/pipeline.yaml`; an
  application still on `generated_workflow` is converted with `ankra application pipeline convert`.
- **Immutable image tags.** Commit SHA or semver; never `latest`. This is what makes promotion and
  rollback meaningful.
- **Secrets by stdin or prompt**, never `--value`, and never printed back into a transcript.
- **`env-secrets set` then `env-secrets apply`.** Setting alone does not reach a running workload.
- **Verify before promoting.** Operations, pods, logs — in that order. A green `deploy` command is
  not a working service.
- **Nothing is finished until it is reproducible.** If a deploy only works because someone edited a
  live resource, it is not deployed.
- **`ankra application delete` is destructive**; confirm the application id and what it is running
  before you run it.
