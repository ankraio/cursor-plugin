# Ankra security

Ankra has five distinct places where access is granted. Confusing them is how a "read-only" token
ends up able to open pull requests, and how a developer who needed to read logs ends up
`cluster-admin`.

| Layer | Grants | Managed with |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| **API tokens** | What a script or an MCP client can call | `ankra tokens` |
| **Organisation roles** | What a member can do in Ankra | `ankra org members`, `ankra org roles` |
| **Cluster access grants** | Kubernetes API access through the Ankra gateway | `ankra cluster access` |
| **Credentials** | What Ankra can reach in Git, registries and clouds | `ankra credentials`, `ankra helm credentials` |
| **Agent autonomy** | What the AI may do without a human | Ask/Agent mode, MCP tool grants |

## 1. API tokens and MCP scopes

```bash
ankra tokens list
ankra tokens create ci-payments --expires 2026-12-31
ankra tokens create cursor-readonly --scopes mcp:read
ankra tokens create agent-writer   --scopes mcp:read,mcp:write
ankra tokens revoke <token-id>
ankra tokens delete <token-id>          # only after it is revoked
```

- **Omitting `--scopes` creates a REST-only token** — it can drive the CLI and API but exposes no
  MCP tool surface. That is the right default for CI.
- **`mcp:read`** is the Ask surface: reads plus the curated safe creations (a workspace pod, a
  throwaway PR demo, a brand-new stack). Give this to an editor integration.
- **`mcp:read,mcp:write`** adds the mutating tools, including opening fix pull requests. Give it
  only where you want the agent to act.
- **Always set `--expires`.** A token with no expiry is a permanent credential nobody will
  remember to rotate.
- Revoke first, delete second — the two-step exists so an accidental delete cannot hide an active
  credential.

Resolution order in the CLI is `--token`, then the saved login from `ankra login`, then
`ANKRA_API_TOKEN`. A saved login **beats** the environment variable, so a script that seems to
ignore `ANKRA_API_TOKEN` usually needs `ankra logout` first.

Store tokens in the CI secret store or the environment — never in the repository, never in a
committed `.ankra.yaml`.

## 2. Organisation roles and membership

```bash
ankra org members
ankra org roles                          # the assignable roles
ankra org invite <email> --role viewer   # owner, admin, operator, member, viewer, read-only
ankra org remove <email>
ankra org current
```

Invite at the lowest role that works, and review membership when people change teams. Role is also
what gates MCP tool grants (below), so a wide role quietly widens agent capability too.

## 3. Cluster access through the kube gateway

```bash
ankra cluster access list --cluster prod
ankra cluster access grant alice@example.com --cluster prod --role view
ankra cluster access grant bob@example.com --cluster prod --role edit --namespace payments
ankra cluster access revoke alice@example.com --cluster prod
```

Roles map to the standard Kubernetes ClusterRoles: `view`, `edit`, `admin`, `cluster-admin`. Grants
are **cluster-wide by default** — pass `--namespace` to scope one.

Two rules that carry most of the value here:

- **`view` is enough for troubleshooting.** `ankra cluster logs --previous`, `describe`, `events`
  and `top` all work through the agent without a grant at all; a grant is only needed for direct
  `kubectl`. Reaching for `edit` to read a crash log is a common and unnecessary escalation.
- **`cluster-admin` needs a named reason and a review date.** Treat every existing one as a finding
  until someone justifies it.

```bash
ankra cluster kubeconfig add --use     # a kubeconfig context using ankra cluster kube-token
ankra cluster kubeconfig list
ankra cluster kubeconfig remove <context>
```

The kubeconfig credential plugin mints short-lived credentials per call, so there is no long-lived
kubeconfig to leak. Read-only kubectl through it is fine; mutations belong in the GitOps repo.

## 4. Credentials: scope, and what they can really reach

```bash
ankra credentials list
ankra credentials get <name>
ankra credentials repositories <name>    # what a Git credential can ACTUALLY reach
ankra credentials validate <name>
ankra helm credentials list
```

`credentials repositories` is the one to run in a review: a Git credential that was meant for one
repository frequently reaches an entire organisation, and nothing in its name says so.

- Scope Git credentials to the repositories Ankra needs, and no more.
- Registry credentials come in three flavours and should not be shared: a **push** credential for
  CI, a **read** credential for Ankra, and a **pull secret** for the cluster. Where the registry
  supports it, hand Ankra an **admin** credential so it mints a narrow per-application robot
  instead — see `ankra-app-integrations`.
- Cloud provider credentials should be scoped to the project/subscription Ankra manages.

## 5. Secrets

```bash
ankra cluster sops-config                          # the public key in use
ankra cluster encrypt manifest <name> --key password --key username
ankra cluster encrypt addon <name> --key apiKey
ankra cluster decrypt manifest <name>              # verify shape, never to copy values
ankra application env-secrets list <application-id>
```

- **Nothing sensitive is committed in plaintext.** Encrypt with SOPS and declare `encrypted_paths`
  so Ankra decrypts the right fields — an encrypted value with no declared path deploys as
  ciphertext.
- **Never print a decrypted value** into a terminal transcript, a pull request, a commit message,
  an issue, or chat. Report the key name and its state.
- **Rotate and re-encrypt when access changes**, and scope decryption to the clusters that need it.
- Opening a stack profile builder draft on a published profile **drops `encrypted_paths`** —
  re-declare them before publishing (see `ankra-stack-profiles`).

## 6. Supply chain

```bash
ankra application upgrade-workflow <application-id>    # add scanning to the build workflow
ankra application code-security <application-id>
ankra application container-security <application-id>
ankra application security-versions <application-id>   # every published tag: BOM, findings, where it runs, licence verdict
ankra application pull-request-reviews <application-id>
```

An application whose build workflow has no scanning step is a finding in itself. So is a floating
image tag or an unpinned chart version: a mutable tag means the artefact you reviewed is not
necessarily the artefact that runs, which defeats every other control here.

## 7. The Security Center: findings, KEV and EPSS

```bash
ankra security overview                          # fleet totals, KEV exposure, scanner coverage
ankra security findings --known-exploited        # the CVEs CISA lists as exploited in the wild
ankra security findings --severity critical --fixable true --sort epss
ankra security finding <finding-id>              # CISA's guidance and every active occurrence
ankra security finding <finding-id> --status resolved --cluster <c>   # the paged occurrence listing
ankra security workloads --known-exploited       # scanned workloads ranked by risk score
ankra security clusters --status stale           # per-cluster posture and scanner freshness
ankra security namespaces --cluster <c>          # per-namespace posture; rows sum to the cluster
ankra security pods --cluster <c> --namespace <ns>   # each container joined to its scanned workload
ankra security addon <addon> --cluster <c>       # one add-on's attributed findings on a cluster
ankra security advisory CVE-2026-1234            # the platform's advisory: NVD/OSV, CISA, your exposure
```

Dispositions - the acknowledgements and accepted risks that shape the actionable set:

```bash
ankra security dispositions --status expiring --status fix_available   # what needs review
ankra security dispositions preview --occurrence <id> --disposition accepted_risk
ankra security dispositions create --occurrence <id> --disposition acknowledged --reason "..." --expires-at 2026-12-31
ankra security dispositions update <policy-id> --expires-at 2027-03-31
ankra security dispositions revoke <policy-id> --reason "fix rolled out"
```

Software bill of materials and licences:

```bash
ankra security sbom --vulnerable true            # fleet package inventory, packages a finding names
ankra security sbom --license-risk network_copyleft --license-risk source_available
ankra security sbom images --cluster <c>         # images publishing a BOM and where they run
ankra security sbom image <digest>               # one image's components and licences
ankra security sbom findings <digest>            # the CVEs named on one image
ankra security sbom containers --status absent   # running containers with no BOM
ankra security sbom export <digest> --format cyclonedx --output-file app.cdx.json
```

Compliance and per-cluster posture:

```bash
ankra security compliance                        # every cluster's benchmark pass/fail totals
ankra security compliance frameworks             # GDPR, ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST CSF with scores
ankra security compliance frameworks enable soc2
ankra security compliance frameworks report soc2 --month 2026-08
ankra security compliance export --format json --output-file evidence.json   # needs audit.read
ankra security benchmarks --cluster <c>          # CIS and other benchmarks, failing controls with remediation
ankra security benchmarks resources --cluster <c> --check 5.1.1 --benchmark cis-1.23
ankra security violations --cluster <c>          # pod-security policy results and the policy mode
ankra security network-exposure --cluster <c>    # NetworkPolicy over-privilege per direction
ankra security policy-mode enforce --cluster <c> # audit -> enforce; always confirms
ankra security policy-mode off --cluster <c>     # uninstall the Kyverno engine; native pod security stays in audit
ankra security enable-baseline --cluster <c>     # install the scanner and policy add-ons
ankra security history --cluster <c> --days 30   # daily snapshots: how the posture moved
ankra security report-schedule --cluster <c>     # the emailed security report: frequency, recipients, last sent
ankra security report-schedule set --cluster <c> --frequency weekly --recipient sec@example.com
ankra security report-schedule send --cluster <c> # queue one report now
```

This is the portal's Security Center from the terminal - one logical finding per CVE and
package, deduplicated across clusters and workloads, each carrying its exploitation
intelligence: whether CISA lists the CVE in its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog (with
the remediation deadline and required action) and the FIRST EPSS probability of exploitation
in the next 30 days.

- **The default sort is exploitability** - CISA listing first, then EPSS, then severity - so
  the top of the list is what is being exploited, not what merely has the highest CVSS score.
  Work it top-down; a medium on the KEV list outranks an unexploited critical.
- The default listing is the actionable set (open and acknowledged). `--status any` widens it
  to accepted-risk and resolved findings; `--cluster`, `--addon` and `--namespace` narrow the
  blast radius question.
- **`security clusters` answers "can I trust this picture?"** - a cluster whose scanner is
  `stale` or `unscanned` has findings you are not seeing. Treat scanner freshness as a
  finding of its own.
- `advisory` works for any CVE id, in a finding or not - the fastest answer to "are we
  exposed to the CVE in this morning's headlines?".
- **A disposition is a decision with a blast radius**: `preview` first, always give a
  `--reason`, set `--expires-at` or `--expire-when-fix-available` so it comes back for review.
  `accepted_risk` needs `security.manage`; `acknowledged` needs `security.triage`.
- **Absent is not negative.** An unsynced KEV or EPSS feed prints as unknown, a container with
  no report is "not scanned", a cluster whose agent is offline reads not_available with the
  reason. Never report any of these as clean.
- SBOM generation is opt-in per cluster (`trivy_sbom_generation_enabled` in the security
  baseline profile); the coverage line says how many scanned clusters publish one.
- Everything takes `-o json` for reporting and automation; the two exports write files.

## 8. Agent autonomy

```bash
ankra org mcp-servers list
ankra org mcp-servers get <name>
ankra org mcp-servers tools <name>
ankra org mcp-servers grants <name>                    # per-tool role grants
ankra org mcp-servers grant <name> <tool> --role admin
ankra org mcp-servers revoke-grant <name> <tool> --role admin
ankra org mcp-servers disable <name>
ankra agents runs --status failed
```

- **Ask is the safe default and the gateway fails closed to it.** A binding with no explicit mode
  inherits the organisation default, which is `ask` until an admin changes it.
- **Agent mode auto-opens pull requests** — that is the design; the PR is the review gate. It never
  merges and never force-pushes.
- **MCP servers**: prefer `--tier read_only`, keep `--allowed-tools` to what is actually needed,
  restrict with `--cluster` where a server should only serve some clusters, and store credential
  headers with `--secret-header` (a secret slot) rather than `--header` (plaintext).
- Grant mutating tools to the narrowest role that needs them, not to `member`.

See `ankra-ai-agents` for the full surface and `ankra-ai-gateway` for the Ask/Agent contract.

## A review pass, in order

```bash
ankra tokens list                        # no-expiry tokens, over-scoped mcp:write
ankra org members ; ankra org roles      # who holds what
ankra cluster access list --cluster <c>  # cluster-admin, cluster-wide grants
ankra credentials list                   # then `credentials repositories` on each Git credential
ankra cluster sops-config                # secrets encrypted, paths declared
ankra application container-security <a> # per application; and code-security, security-versions
ankra security overview                  # KEV exposure and scanner coverage across the fleet
ankra security findings --known-exploited # what is actually being exploited, fix these first
ankra security dispositions --status expiring --status fix_available   # accepted risks due for review
ankra security compliance                # benchmark posture per cluster; not_available is a finding
ankra security sbom containers --status absent   # running containers with no bill of materials
ankra org mcp-servers list               # read_write tiers, wide tool grants
ankra backup vaults list                 # every vault ready, keys scoped to their bucket
```

Report findings ranked by exposure: what is reachable, by whom, and the one command or change that
closes it. Do not change anything in a review pass without asking, and never print a secret value.

## Rules

- **Least privilege at every layer**, and the layers are independent — a narrow role does not
  narrow a token.
- **Expiry on every token.** Revoke, then delete.
- **`view` before `edit`, `edit` before `admin`**, namespace-scoped before cluster-wide.
- **Plaintext secrets never reach Git**, and decrypted values never reach a transcript.
- **Pin every artefact.** Unpinned images and charts make review meaningless.
- **Ask mode by default**; promote a binding to Agent deliberately, per binding.
- **Destructive commands confirm first** (`delete`, `uninstall`, `deprovision`, `revoke`) — check
  the organisation and cluster with `ankra org current` and `ankra cluster info` before running one.
