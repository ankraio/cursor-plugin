# Ankra Stacks & Addons

A Stack is Ankra's reusable unit of deployment: it bundles Helm addons, raw manifests, variables, and the dependency edges between them. Stacks live inside a cluster (and, with GitOps, in a Git repo).

## Building blocks

- **Addon** — a Helm release: `chart_name`, `chart_version`, `repository_url`, `namespace`, and `configuration.values`. Optional `agents_md` (inline markdown) or `agents_md_from_file` (path) attaches an AGENTS.md of operational learnings, stored next to the addon in the GitOps repo.
- **Manifest** — raw Kubernetes YAML (namespaces, ConfigMaps, CRDs, RBAC, anything Helm does not own). Also takes optional `agents_md` / `agents_md_from_file`.
- **Variable** — a named value substituted into manifests/addon values, so the same stack works across environments.
- **Parents** — dependency edges. A resource deploys only after every parent has succeeded.

AGENTS.md semantics: omit the field to preserve what is stored, set `""` to clear it, and editing it never redeploys anything. Content is plain markdown (never encrypted — no secrets). Use it to record durable operational learnings after non-obvious operations so future agents benefit.

## Deployment order via `parents`

Order is a graph, not a list. Declare what each resource needs:

```yaml
manifests:
  - name: monitoring-ns
    parents: []
  - name: grafana-dashboards
    parents:
      - manifest: monitoring-ns
addons:
  - name: kube-prometheus-stack
    chart_name: kube-prometheus-stack
    chart_version: 65.1.1
    repository_url: https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    namespace: monitoring
    agents_md_from_file: agents/kube-prometheus-stack.AGENTS.md
    parents:
      - manifest: monitoring-ns
      - manifest: grafana-dashboards
```

Edit parents after the fact with the CLI instead of re-applying everything:

```bash
ankra cluster addons upgrade kube-prometheus-stack \
  --add-parent name=monitoring-ns,kind=manifest --cluster prod
```

## Variables over hardcoding

Promote anything environment-specific (domains, replica counts, storage classes, sizes) to a variable and reference it, rather than baking literals into addon values. This keeps a stack reusable across dev/staging/prod and avoids copy-paste drift.

## Design rules

- **Small, focused stacks.** One concern per stack (logging, monitoring, ingress) beats a single mega-stack — easier to reason about, reorder, and clone.
- **Namespace first.** The namespace manifest is a parent of everything deployed into it.
- **Pin chart versions.** Exact `chart_version` everywhere; never floating in production.
- **Test before prod.** Roll a stack out to dev/staging, then promote the same definition to production.
- **Values are a contract.** Keep `configuration.values` minimal and intentional; rely on chart defaults otherwise.

## Inspecting and changing

```bash
ankra cluster stacks list
ankra cluster addons list
ankra cluster addons settings <addon>     # show stored values
ankra cluster addons upgrade <addon>       # change version/values/parents
ankra cluster manifests upgrade <name>
```

## One stack, many clusters

The moment a stack would be copy-pasted to a second cluster and edited, stop and capture it as a
stack profile instead: every per-cluster difference becomes a parameter, and the two clusters
cannot drift apart silently. `ankra cluster stacks clone <stack> --to <cluster>` is the one-off
route (it lands as a draft on the target and strips encrypted values, which must be reconfigured
there); a profile is the durable one. See `ankra-stack-profiles`. A clone copies configuration
only unless `--with-data` is passed, which carries the stack's data through a backup vault -
see `ankra-backups`.
