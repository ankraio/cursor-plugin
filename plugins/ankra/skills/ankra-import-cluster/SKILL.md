description: Author and apply an Ankra ImportCluster YAML manifest that connects an existing Kubernetes cluster, wires a GitOps repository, and declares stacks of manifests and Helm addons with dependency ordering. Use when the user wants to import or onboard a cluster into Ankra, write a cluster.yaml / ImportCluster file, or apply one with `ankra cluster apply`.

# Ankra ImportCluster

An `ImportCluster` manifest is the declarative entry point for onboarding an existing Kubernetes cluster (EKS, GKE, AKS, on-prem, k3s, kind, minikube) into Ankra. Apply it with `ankra cluster apply -f cluster.yaml`.

## Anatomy

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ImportCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  description: Importing my Kubernetes cluster
spec:
  git_repository:                 # optional: enable GitOps for this cluster
    provider: github
    credential_name: my-git-credential
    repository: my-org/my-gitops-repo
    branch: main
  stacks:
    - name: logging
      description: Stack for logging
      manifests:
        - name: namespace-fluent-bit
          parents: []
          from_file: "manifests/fluent-bit-namespace.yaml"
        - name: configmap-fluent-bit
          parents:
            - kind: manifest
              name: namespace-fluent-bit
          from_file: "manifests/fluent-bit-configmap.yaml"
      addons:
        - name: fluent-bit
          chart_name: fluent-bit
          chart_version: 0.49.1          # pin exact version, especially in prod
          repository_url: https://fluent.github.io/helm-charts
          namespace: fluent-bit
          parents:
            - kind: manifest
              name: configmap-fluent-bit
          configuration:
            values: |-
              service:
                enabled: true
```

## Field reference

- `spec.git_repository` — connect a Git repo so stacks are stored and synced from Git (see `ankra-gitops`). Omit for a non-GitOps import.
- `spec.stacks[]` — each stack groups related `manifests` and `addons`.
- `manifests[]` — raw Kubernetes YAML. Use `from_file: "path.yaml"` to reference a file, or `manifest: |-` for inline content.
- `addons[]` — Helm releases. Required: `chart_name`, `chart_version`, `namespace`. Name the chart source with `registry_name` + `registry_url` (with `registry_credential_name` for a private registry — see `ankra-helm-registries`); the older `repository_url` is still accepted. Configure via `configuration.values: |-` (inline) or `configuration.from_file:`.
- `agents_md` / `agents_md_from_file` — optional per-manifest and per-addon AGENTS.md: operational learnings in plain markdown, stored as a sibling file in the GitOps repo (e.g. `agents_md_from_file: "manifests/fluent-bit.AGENTS.md"`). Omitting the field preserves the stored content, an explicit empty string clears it, and editing it never triggers a redeploy. Plaintext only — never put secrets in it. After any non-obvious operation (a values quirk, an upgrade pitfall, a dependency gotcha), record what you learned here so future agents working on the same addon or manifest benefit.
- `group` — optional per-manifest and per-addon organizational label within the stack (a quoted string, e.g. `group: "platform services"`). Purely organizational: it never triggers a redeploy. Keep whatever the exported file carries — apply prunes what the file no longer declares, so removing the key removes the resource from its group.
- `parents` — the dependency edges that control deployment order. A resource only deploys after its parents succeed. Every parent is a `kind` + `name` pair — write both keys (`- kind: manifest` / `name: <name>`, or `kind: addon`). **The shorthand `- manifest: <name>` does not work**: it parses to an empty parent and the edge is silently dropped, while both local and server-side validation still pass. Verify what was stored with `ankra cluster stacks list <stack> -o json`.

## Workflow

1. Create namespaces as manifests first; make dependent addons/configmaps list that namespace manifest in `parents`.
2. Pin every addon's `chart_version` to an exact version.
3. Keep secret material out of plaintext — encrypt with SOPS and mark `encrypted_paths` (see `ankra-sops-secrets`).
4. Validate and apply:

```bash
ankra cluster validate -f cluster.yaml     # server-side checks, changes nothing
ankra cluster draft -f cluster.yaml        # stage every stack as a reviewable draft instead
ankra cluster apply -f cluster.yaml
ankra cluster operations list              # watch the resulting operation
```

`apply` is a declarative **replace** per stack: what the file no longer declares is removed from
that stack. `draft` is the safe route on a cluster you are not ready to change.

## Rules

- Namespace manifests must come before anything deployed into that namespace, expressed via `parents`.
- Pin chart versions; never use floating/`latest` charts in production.
- Reference files with forward-slash relative paths (`manifests/foo.yaml`), resolved from the manifest's location.
- Keep stacks small and focused (one concern each) rather than one giant stack.
