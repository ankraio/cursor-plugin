description: Structure an Ankra GitOps repository with modular include paths so cluster and stack definitions are stored in Git and synced to the cluster by the Ankra engine. Use when the user connects a Git repository to a cluster, organizes a GitOps repo layout, or wants Git to be the source of truth for their Kubernetes configuration.

# Ankra GitOps

With GitOps enabled, a cluster's stacks are stored in a Git repository and synced to the cluster by the Ankra engine. Git becomes the single source of truth; changes flow through commits and pull requests, not manual edits.

## Connect a repo

In the `ImportCluster` spec:

```yaml
spec:
  git_repository:
    provider: github            # github, gitlab, ...
    credential_name: my-git-credential
    repository: my-org/my-gitops-repo
    branch: main
```

The `credential_name` references a Git credential stored in Ankra (least-privilege deploy token /
app install); `ankra credentials repositories <name>` shows what it can actually reach.

When Ankra *builds* the cluster, skip the retrofit entirely: every provider `create` and
`ankra cluster managed create` take `--gitops-repository`, `--gitops-credential-name` and
`--gitops-branch`, and the generated cloud-provider stack lands in the repo as a commit from day
one (`ankra-cloud-clusters`). Inspect the wiring later with:

```bash
ankra cluster gitops status        # repository, branch, credential, last synced commit, sync errors
```

## Modular layout with include paths

Keep the repo modular instead of one enormous file. A typical layout:

```
gitops-repo/
├── cluster.yaml                 # ImportCluster: references the stacks below
├── stacks/
│   ├── ingress/
│   │   ├── stack.yaml
│   │   └── manifests/
│   ├── monitoring/
│   │   ├── stack.yaml
│   │   └── values/
│   └── logging/
│       └── stack.yaml
└── manifests/
    └── shared/
```

- One directory per stack; reference manifest and values files by relative path from where they are declared.
- Split large stacks into their own files/folders rather than inlining everything.
- Shared raw manifests live in a common folder and are referenced from multiple stacks.

## Workflow

1. Branch from `main`, edit the relevant `stack.yaml` / manifests.
2. Open a pull request; review the diff.
3. Merge to the synced branch — the Ankra engine reconciles the change onto the cluster.
4. Confirm with `ankra cluster gitops status` (repository, branch, last synced commit, any sync
   error) and `ankra cluster operations list`.

## Rules

- **Git is the source of truth.** Do not hand-edit cluster state out of band; change the repo and let it sync.
- **Protect the synced branch.** Require PR review; treat merges as deploys.
- **Encrypt secrets before commit.** Never commit plaintext Secrets — use SOPS (`ankra-sops-secrets`).
- **Pin versions.** Exact chart versions and immutable image tags so a commit fully determines what runs.
- **Small, reviewable commits.** One logical change per PR; the diff should read as "what will deploy".
